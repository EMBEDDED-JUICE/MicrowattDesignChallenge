# Transparent Self-Monitoring Microwatt

**Hackathon:** [Microwatt Momentum – OpenPOWER HW Design Hackathon](https://chipfoundry.org/)  
**Theme:** *"Microwatt for the open computing era"*

---

## 📌 Abstract
This project enhances the open-source **Microwatt POWER CPU core** by integrating a real-time **on-chip telemetry and debug engine**. The engine continuously monitors pipeline activity, instruction flow, and performance metrics such as:

- Instructions per cycle (IPC)  
- Branch mispredictions  
- Stall cycles  
- Memory accesses  

It exposes this information through memory-mapped registers accessible to software and provides an optional trace buffer for instruction history.  

The goal is to make **Microwatt more developer-friendly** by providing built-in observability, enabling researchers, FPGA developers, and students to debug, profile, and optimize workloads without relying on external debug tools.  

This proposal advances Microwatt into the era of **transparent, self-diagnosing open CPUs**, bridging the gap between academic research and practical deployment.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs):** IPC, branch misprediction count, stall cycles, memory access latency.  
- **On-Chip Trace Buffer:** Captures recent instruction PCs + opcodes, FIFO-based, triggered capture support.  
- **Telemetry Export:** Memory-mapped registers, C demo software for stats, optional UART/JTAG export.  
- **Verification & Reproducibility:** RTL-level testbenches, validation against software-instrumented models, documented OpenLane flow.

## 🎯 Why This Project
- **Practical & New:** Adds observability infrastructure directly inside Microwatt.  
- **Educational Impact:** Helps students and researchers learn CPU behavior.  
- **Community Benefit:** Improves reproducibility for Microwatt-based designs.  
- **Feasible:** Modular RTL design fits OpenFrame SoC user area with clear scope.
