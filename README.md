# Transparent Self-Monitoring Microwatt

**Hackathon:** [Microwatt Momentum â€“ OpenPOWER HW Design Hackathon](https://chipfoundry.org/)  
**Theme:** *"Microwatt for the open computing era"*

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract

The **Transparent Self-Monitoring Microwatt** project aims to transform the open-source [Microwatt POWER CPU core](https://git.openpower.foundation/cores/microwatt) into a **self-observable and developer-friendly platform** by embedding real-time performance monitoring and telemetry capabilities directly into the CPU pipeline. While Microwatt already provides an accessible reference design for the POWER ISA, debugging and performance analysis often depend on external tools, intrusive instrumentation, or FPGA probes. This creates a barrier for students, researchers, and open-hardware developers who wish to study microarchitectural behavior or optimize workloads on resource-constrained platforms.

To address this, our design introduces a **lightweight telemetry and debug subsystem** that continuously monitors key pipeline signals and records essential performance metrics. These include **instructions per cycle (IPC), branch prediction accuracy, stall cycles, and memory latency metrics**, which are critical for both academic research and practical optimization. Additionally, we implement a configurable **on-chip trace buffer** that captures a short instruction history, enabling step-by-step workload analysis without external trace hardware.  

All telemetry data is made accessible through **memory-mapped registers** within the OpenFrame SoC environment, and a **C software demo** demonstrates how to retrieve and visualize this information. For extended use, telemetry can also be exported through UART or JTAG interfaces, allowing integration with standard debugging workflows.  

From a reproducibility standpoint, the project adheres to **hackathon requirements** by providing fully open-source RTL, AI prompt logs (if applicable), STA and SDF constraints, and OpenLane/chipIgnite configuration files for SKY130 implementation. This ensures that any participant or community member can reproduce results, validate design choices, and extend the work for future research.  

By embedding self-monitoring into Microwatt, this project bridges the gap between **research CPUs** and **production observability frameworks**, helping the open-source hardware ecosystem advance toward **transparent, self-diagnosing processors**. The result is a powerful educational and research tool that empowers developers to learn CPU internals, debug complex workloads, and accelerate innovation in the open computing era.
